#Howdy & welcome to the goat farm! 

Super happy you found this weird little place. Please drop an intro on the Rising Stars page and check out our Barnyard Rules. 
Rising Stars is THE place to find your friends. Think of this post as a way to raise up that freak flag, watch it fly, and get inspired by everyone in the herd. 
RULEZ: keep it simple, you silly goose! let's start with nouns & adjectives (you know... people, places, things, and sprinkle in a little love).

It could look something like this:


What is GOOD everyone, I'm !8 (she/her) and I am just starting my small business, Goat Herders LLC, near Bass Lake Park in MPLS. I'm passionate about data visualization, systems optimization, and sustainability from the ground up (but actually out if you're a fungi like me). If you need help navigating the system as a small business or spicy brain, or maybe you just really like a great fireworks show -- I might know a guy. 

I love to walk to my local Trader Joes or Fresh Thyme and ride my bike to Bde Maka Ska when the weather's nice. 
My favorite place for coffee is Ceres and beer just tastes better at Wooden Ship Brewing.

I work a corporate job and my hours are flexible. 
If you see me -- please say hi!!! I love everything and dare you to find something I hate more than Columbus & Ronald Reagan's Space Lazers (GTS). 
My bark is worse than my bite and sometimes I just get a little too excited when I've got a fun idea or I meet new people :)


Sending peace & love into the void,

!8


DOES THIS PROMPT SUCK? IT'S REALLY BORING AND YOU COULD SOUND LIKE A dorky dad IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.
DONT WORRY WE LOVE OUR DADDIES!! TURN THAT DORKASAURUS REX INTO A DINO-MITE INTRO BY ADDING YOUR SECRET SAUCE.
MAKE IT A POEM, OR A SONG, OR JUST MAKE THE BEST PROFILE OF ALL TIME AND WE'LL GET THE VIBE.

NOT FOLLOWING ANY OF THIS? REACH OUT TO A CARE BEAR OR CONTACT !8 on signal. 

DEEP BREATHS. YOU GOT THIS!!! WE DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, WE ALREADY KNOW YOU'RE AWESOME BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE
JUST TAKE IT SLOW, AND DON'T WORRY YOU CAN CHANGE IT WHENEVER YOU WANT (BC DUH).
