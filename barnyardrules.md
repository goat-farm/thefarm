# how can we make internet language more inclusive? add color, stickers, notes, and context (teacher-ify that shit)
# use () to add context
# use {} to explain snark/sarcasm/irony
# use [] to explain ___?___
# use _?_ if you're still thinking but the rest of your idea is there (we love WIP!!!)
# use # to add a random comment or question

# before resorting to hate and violence: take a chill pill, a nap, eat a cookie, and call a CARE BEAR
